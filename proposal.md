# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Dynamic/Interactive Music

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will involve music and how it changes based on what the player does within a game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

From what I have seen from my experience with modern videogames and the gaming track on canvas, my code would play a default sound(music) when
the player is idle. But if an object(enemy) enters the screen and the player collides with the object the default sound will turn off and more
aggressive music will play until all object have left the screen. In conclusion, this will act a lot like mario. When mario collides with certain 
objects in the game the game's sound changes briefly, then the sound cuts off. For example, when mario hits a block or falls off screen there is 
a specific sound for that event. I attempt to do this for my final project.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I do not have another course to combine this final project with.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am working alone on this project.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish the basic structure of collision detection and have a sound attached to that collision.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Based on the Mario and Pong track, I think setting up an environment where the music changes based on what the player interacts with is the better outcome if executed
correctly.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to accomplish a very basic, but fully functional game with features I mentioned at the beginning of this proposal.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I plan on checking out GameMaker, it is software I have used before and I have actually made a game where music changes when you collide with objects like spikes
or sawblades. Additionally, you can drag and drop what you want to happen in your game and change how you want it to function. You can also code in it as well. But
most of my time will be spent learning more about lua and researching other ways to make interactive music for basic games. If everything goes well I expect to have
a fully fucntional game with a lot of different sounds that change depending on the object encountered.
