My experiences with both Lilypond, Frescobaldi, and Cakewalk were frustrating 
to say the least. Although, my time with them gave me a new perspective after really 
practicing with things involving very minute details and making sure you are also 
efficient as possible. Getting a track in Cakewalk to sound exactly how you want it to with
not much of a background in music other than high school band was tedious, but worth it. I enjoyed 
my time with python and the meticulous nature of computer science. The greatest pleasure
I got while working on this project was finding new sounds and applying them to what I had 
already put together to make it even better. This was difficult work, but when you are creating
something you are invested in it comes together almost perfectly. I have attached a link to my
project below....
